GUIDELINES:

* Accidents.dbf is a file of traffic accidents in the USA with geolocation of data

* All_Starbucks_location.csv is also a file with geolocation of Starbucks stores in the US

* Apple_Data_300.csv is a stock market data (date, open, close, high, low, volume) for AAPL in a 10 years interval

* Apple_Data_300_SVM.csv is a stock market data (close) for AAPL in a 10 years interval

* Autoencoder_04767.hdf5 is a weight file for the autoencoder model developed with Keras

* Brasil.shp is a file with Brazil map, used in R file

* Collab.Filtering.csv Data is a file with a missing NaN value whose input is obtained through the Collaborative Filtering.py file

* DadosTeseLogit.csv is a file with 29 features and 2 target variables. Column 30 is a continuous variable used for regression models and
column 31 is a binary variable, used for classification. Data was obtained in my Doctorate thesis, in a market research with 100
people. Data presents low variance.

* DadosTeseLogit3.csv is a file with 29 features and 2 target variables. Column 30 is a continuous variable used for regression models and
column 31 is a variable with 3 classes, used for classification. Data was obtained in my Doctorate thesis, in a market research with 100
people. Data presents low variance.

* Digits_.csv is a mini MNIST dataset, with 1765 handwritten digits of a 8 x 8 array

* Edges2000.csv is a file used for social network modeling, presenting connections from and to for 2000 individuals.

* EmailsData4.xlsx is a file used for social network modeling, presenting connections from and to, used in Mathematica model.

* GameR.csv is a file from the game sector used for non linear regression.

* haarcascade is a file used for OpenCV face recognition in Python.

* imdb.d2v is a file of movie reviews

* international-airline-passengers.csv is a file used for time series analysis

* Jennifer.jpg is a file used for face recognition in R

* JenniferGroup.jpg is a file used for face recognition using OpenCV in Python

* LSTM.hdf5 is a weight file for the neural network model developed in Keras - Python

* mnist_test10.csv is a test set file with 10 digits, for simple MNIST task models

* mnist_test2k.csv is a train set file with 2000 digits, for simple MNIST task models

* mnist.pkl.gz is the whole set of training and test MNIST dataset (handwritten digits), with 60,000 and 10,000 examples, for the MNIST
task. Each example is made of 28 x 28 pixels.

* Multinomial.csv is a file used for multinomial logistic regression

* quantum.txt is a small text file used for LSTM Neural Networks and Autoencoders

* questao1.csv is a file to define employee turnover, but features have no significant correlation with target, what makes hard for
prediction. The idea is to make a prediction of who is going to leave the company (label 1) and who is not (label 0). Useful file for
data cleaning, because it contains dates, hours, currency and missing values.

* questao1NN.csv is the same file questao1.csv, cleaned with best features chosen for use in Neural Networks.

* test-neg.txt is a simple set of 8 negative movie reviews, for Natural Language Processing learning

* test-pos.txt is a simple set of 8 positive movie reviews, for Natural Language Processing learning

* train-neg.txt is simple a set of 8 negative movie reviews, for Natural Language Processing learning

* train-pos.txt is a simple set of 8 positive movie reviews, for Natural Language Processing learning

* VAE.610065.hdf5 is a variational autoencoder weight file.

* weights.improvement is a neural network weight file.

* ZarathustraSmall.txt is a file with Nietsche's Zarathustra chapters, used for autoencoders
